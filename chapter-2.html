     <img class="grpelem" id="u5575-30" alt="Chapter 2: Who’s responsible for protect the Minorities – the government or the people themselves? The Flint water crisis was one case in which we see intense indifference about a group of people safety and health – specifically those living in Flint, Michigan. The incident originally sparked from a 2012-2013 discussion about changing Flint's water source to save fundings. In that very moment, Flint was in extreme poverty and heavily underfunded, so Michigan state took control of this crisis. Projecting that they can save $200 million by terminating their purchase of water from Detroit (which gets their water from Lake Huron), they decided to start a massive construction to get their own water from Lake Huron directly. Temporarily, they were transitioned to the Flint river, notorious for the 19th century industrial dumps and abandonment. Starting from the 1830s, paper and coal factories to the vehicle production sectors had virtually no regulation of where the waste went. And even with the regulations applied, companies like GM secretly found legal loopholes to avoid them. By the time the government had the Clean Water Acts, the river was already contaminated beyond federal limits. There was also one incident where the sewer pipes malfunctioned and “22 million gallons of raw human, industrial, residential and commercial waste poured into the river” in the course of only 2 days. People reported tasting hard water and seeing rivers filled with dead fish floating on the surface. Researchers stated that it would take 10 times more effort to fix this river than other waterways, on average. Thus, the river was abandoned and Flint switched to Detroit water." width="1080" height="1144" src="images/u5575-30.png?crc=4203245257"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

        <img class="grpelem" id="u5964-47" alt="Although the scientific details may not seem important, for this topic, knowing the jargons can give us better understanding of the situation. This will also go through some terms that commonly appear in crisis relating to water treatment. The Treatment Process: The treatment process for such contaminated waters is almost linear in all cases. The government must first kill the bacteria in the water. Commonly, pathogens include E. coli, Legionnaire’s disease, and total coliform. There many people who died to these diseases due to dirty water, and it took the government The chemical used is chlorine, same as those used in swimming pools and have the detergent-like smell. The chlorine is effective at removing bacteria but reacts with many organic materials in the river, creating a toxic byproduct called total trihalomethanes (TTHM). These byproducts cause numerous types of organ-failures. But that was not the most surprising part of this crisis. It was the rusting lead pipes that led to malfunctions in the society. Flint was an city and their pipes were built from lead. They are great for transporting water, but when it comes to drinking water it is different. Lead to known to cause cancer or lead poisoning and is particularly deadly to newborns and pregnant mothers. More recently, lead pipes are covered insides with another material that prevents the lead from dissolving into the drinking waters. The only prerequisite was that the supplying water had to contain phosphates, which do not react with the materials on the layers. So as the diagram portrays, the Flint River was not chemically treated, and naturally had no phosphates compounds preventing the layers from getting leached. The lead pipes started corroding, spreading lead particles to every home in Flint." width="1080" height="1568" src="images/u5964-47.png?crc=4234713895"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

     <img class="grpelem" id="u5967-62" alt="&nbsp;In 2014, the people started seeing brown water. Some children were lead poisoned and others ill due to the diseases in the water. But since lead levels were significantly different based on where you lived, the majority of the people were inactive in fighting for clean water. One other possible cause of this peacefulness was because politicians in the State tried to calm people by assuring that the water had been “in it’s cleanest state since”. There was even a report that said the water was good to be distributed, but there was no proof. Maybe the state government had lied to keep it a secret to the people. But there were people like LeeAnne Walters who stood up. After seeing her kids get lead poisoned or ill from drinking the water, she immediately went into community research. After some campaigning, Virginia Tech professor, Marc Edwards agreed to do a small-scale lead-level-research. It is interesting to note that Virginia had a similar water crises in the past and this could explain their willingness to help out and their expertise in this field. When Virginia Tech released their research materials, showing that some homes had lead levels (in parts per billion or called ppb) of 13200, when EPA considers any water beyond 5000 ppm as hazardous waste. Considering that the acceptable maximum rate is 15 ppm, the lead level witnessed can be considered as a thousand times the federal action level. It is important to note that just because it is within federal action standards doesn't mean it is healthy. The EPA continued to conduct their own research, and a politician stated that they did not need educational facilities to help because they were only spreading fear or commotion among a frightened community, while covering up or tampering with data. It was later revealed that EPA had removed 2 results from their research which they called ‘outliers’ which in fact ranged their average within national action levels. Thus, they claimed the water safe again. But their effort were overran by complaints of people. Governor Rick Snyder apologized and called for support from President Obama, and it was declared a national emergency. Flint decided to reuse water from the Detroit system. The problem was that now the lead pipes had already rusted and even using clean water won't fix the problem. In the end, hundreds of millions are now spent to repair the pipes, which should be complete in around 2020. Free bottled water was supplied but it ran out. In the end, environmental agencies provided water filters to solve the problem but even then the water isn't the safest to drink for some houses. At least as a temporary solution, the people are finally relieved. Obama and Snyder both drank filtered tap water publicly to ensure the quality is within national standards. In conclusion, it is clear that whistle-blowers like Walters’ effort was needed to spread the idea of danger. And sometimes, because resources are limited, politicians will try to save as much money as possible so that they can correctly manage their state and not unfairly devote too much into one specific region. Rick Snyder was caught in this case, eventually losing him all his reputation. While trying to save $200 million for the benefit of the Michigan State, he accidentally disregarded the environmental situation of Flint. This mistake and multiple poor managements and fraud behaviors attempted by multiple politicians to cover up the truth completely put the Flint people in danger and also put the reputation of Snyder to dust in Michigan. Because the American is generally receptive to peoples’ opinions when it comes to life-threatening situations, it is really up to the people to decide whether they will live in a disadvantage. If the population targeted was even smaller than a city, like if it was just a small town, and no one took a stand, it is possible that this disaster would last for even longer.
