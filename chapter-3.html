     <img class="grpelem" id="u7273-84" alt="Mary Mallon was the actual name of the lesser-known women, who in defiance of the government, had been isolated for more than 2 decades in a hospital on an island. Born in Ireland and immigrated to the U.S., she worked in multiple households in New York to earn a living. After cooking bad clams, the most members of the family including Mary had contracted Salmonella. Although she recovered from the fever, the Typhoid pathogens remained in her organs. She was not affected by it. The spreading of diseases began thus. After serving in the family for some time, she left to serve in a new family. She cooked their food, which became a primary factor how she could spread the disease so effectively. She also never washed her hands, making the disease deadlier since no preventive methods were considered. Another family had been infected, but this did not stop her from working in other families to cook. Later on, a detector was hired to investigate on the spread of the Typhoid fever. Discovering that some people sickened even though they did not consume the calms, he had no clue what the cause was. Then later he found out that Mary was a cook that moved from house to house and spread the fever to all the households she had worked in. When he asked for samples of the urine and feces, she rejected him and often locked herself in the room. Back in the late 1800s, police were just starting to gain more power – the government created more specialized departments for different crimes. The government also legalized the private police force for huge industries, which used them for strikebreaking and maintaining the security of the people to prevent mass riots. In the case of Soper, the detective, he was hired by a rich concerned father of a family Mary had worked for. Police were also seen as brutal regulators that brought physical punishment to whoever broke the law. But Mary was a special case, and one of the first to be discovered to be a vector of the disease. In this sense, there was little law or rule, especially since hospitals had just started developing massively to support the public. In the end, Mary’s situation was a gray area. There was no simple justification to arrest her. After an approximate of 3000 New Yorkers contracted with the disease primarily thought to be caused by her (since she was the first discovered carrier), she was a public enemy that the detector sought to capture. After consensus made with the doctors in the town, they managed to capture Mary. Remedy was not available and only came years later, both the immunization and antibiotic treatments (at least 39 years later). However, the human rights concern was that they did not attempt to solve the issue quickly, but only offered remove her gallbladder – known for where the disease is hidden in. The gallbladder removal surgery does not kill her, but back then surgery was very different from the ones today. The facilities and the abilities of the doctors may have been inadequate in Mary's perspective. They just tested and tested and tested with medications available for the 2 years, but without success. A new health director sympathized with Mary and released her, making a contract that she could only work in another job and had to clean her hands very often. Mary complied only for a short time, washing clothing and such. However, she soon changed her name to Mary Brown and continued cooking. This was quickly discovered as the spread of the disease was even greater than last time. This time, Mary worked in public food distribution facilities and caused more trouble. Since then, she was put back into the hospital and remained isolated on the island for 26 more years and died of paralysis one day. We can also look at this in different light. Robert J. T. Joy says, “Now, as far as I am concerned, this verges on assault with the possibility of second degree murder. Mallon knows she carries typhoid, knows she should not cook—and does so.” Also, the physicians who took care of her probably did a poor explanation of what precautions she must take and perform, leaving her confused and afraid of authorities and doctors trying to help her. Her life after release was also miserable, as people called her a monster. She was also not given government support in any way, and all the jobs she could handle had all much lower pay than cooking. In some way, this entire case is a misunderstanding, but it brings to us the questions of human rights versus the welfare of the community. Do we give someone freedom to pursue their dreams, or do we isolate them on an island for the greater freedom of others? This requires us to revisit the concept, is America fundamentally obligated to protect us? So we came to the conclusion that the government today protects the people because there are many laws and organizations that protect peoples' health as a result of larger government positions playing into everyones' lives. Notable people who advanced this idea of protecting the people through government came from Presidents that pushed for public healthcare. For example, FDR and LBJ were both President that advanced such fields in human welfares and expanding humans rights. However, back in the 1800s during Mary's time, medical research was relatively a new profession, and carriers were an unknown concept. Government-controlled public hospitals just started emerging from the 1860s to the 1930s, and it mildly traced the lifetime of Mary. But in this period of development, the government could only focus on the greater good. This was mainly because they did not have much intelligence on the medical fields, and neither did they control the majority of the hospitals. The government had great power but no knowledge of how to handle the power, so they naturally blame what is the cause, putting all the burden on the minority. But in today's perspective, things will be different. Police are more careful with arresting people without sufficient reason because technology allows people to send the word out faster and let victimized people speak for themselves. Like in the Flint water crisis, speaking up is the best way to counter the government's tendency to mistreat minorities. In conclusion, the reason why the government is able to mistreat minorities is not because of government size, but because of how well the government knows about the case to protect the people. Secondly, it is about whether the minority's ideals conflict with the government's stance. When terrorism hit America in 9/11, the government had the power to protect the people by being paranoia about many things. However, the mistreating of Middle-eastern people in America and the prejudice against their culture came from the lack of knowledge of their culture or religion itself. The same goes to the Japanese people in the second World War. It's similar to the idea of &quot;know your enemy to kill it&quot;, but America does the opposite and often mistreats the minorities. The second point was that if the cause the minorities were fighting for was against what the government wanted, they may be ostracized or put into confinement. This includes black riots and womens' rights riots. This is also the case for Mary, who was specifically ordered not to cook again, but she did. Whether what they fought for was right or not, going against the government could cause them their freedom. Freedom from constitution's protection even. This is why America is such a unique nation. In memory of Mary Mallon, here is a modified version of her failed petition for release: George Francis O'Neill To the Editor of the American In reply to Dr. Park of the Board of Health I will state that I am not segregated with the typhoid patients. There is nobody on this island that has typhoid. There was never any effort by the Board authority to do anything for me excepting to cast me on the island and keep me a prisoner without being sick nor needing medical treatment. When I first came here they took two blood cultures, and feces went down three times per week, say Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, respectively, until the latter part of June. After that they only got the feces once a week, which was on Wednesday. Now they have given me a record for nearly a year for three times a week. When I first came here I was so nervous and almost prostrated with grief and trouble. My eyes began to twitch, and the left eyelid became paralyzed and would not move. It remained in that condition for six months. There was an eye specialist [who] visited the island three and four times a week. He was never asked to visit me. I did not even get a cover for my eye. I had to hold my hand on it whilst going about and at night tie a bandage on it. In December when Dr. Wilson took charge, he came to me and I told him about it. He said that was news to him and that he would send me his electric battery, but he never sent [it]. However, my eye got better thanks to the Almighty God and no thanks in spite of the medical staff. Dr. Wilson ordered me urotropin. I got that on and off for a year. Sometimes they had it, and sometimes they did not. I took the urotropin for about three months all told during the whole year. If I should have continued [it], it would certainly have killed me for it was very severe. Everyone knows who is acquainted in any kind of medicine that it's used for kidney trouble. When in January [1908] they were about to discharge me, when the resident physician came to me and asked me where was I going when I got out of here, naturally I said to N.Y., so there was a stop put to my getting out of here. Then the supervising nurse told me I was a hopeless case, and if I'd write to Dr. Darlington and tell him I'd go to my sisters in Connecticut. Now I have no sister in that state or any other in the U.S. Then in April a friend of mine went to Dr. Darlington and asked him when I was to get away. He replied &quot;That woman is all right now, and she is a very expensive woman, but I cannot let her go myself. The Board has to sit. Come around Saturday.&quot; When he did, Dr. Darlington told this man &quot;I've nothing more to do with this woman. Go to Dr. Studdiford.&quot; He went to that doctor, and he said &quot;I cannot let that woman go, and all the people that she gave the typhoid to and so many deaths occurred in the families she was with.&quot; Dr. Studdiford said to this man &quot;Go and ask Mary Mallon and enveigle her to have an operation performed to have her gallbladder removed. I'll have the best surgeon in town to do the cutting.&quot; I said &quot;No. No knife will be put on me. I've nothing the matter with my gallbladder.&quot; Dr. Wilson asked me the very same question. I also told him no. Then he replied &quot;It might not do you any good.&quot; Also the supervising nurse asked me to have an operation performed. I also told her no, and she made the remark &quot;Would it not be better for you to have it done than remain here?&quot; I told her no. There is a visiting doctor who came here in October. He did take quite an interest in me. He really thought I liked it here, that I did not care for my freedom. He asked me if I'd take some medicine if he brought it to me. I said I would, so he brought me some Anti Autotox and some pills then. Dr. Wilson had already ordered me brewer's yeast. At first I would not take it, for I'm a little afraid of the people, and I have a good right for when I came to the Department they said they were in my [intestinal] tract. Later another said they were in the muscles of my bowels. And latterly they thought of the gallbladder. I have been in fact a peep show for everybody. Even the interns had to come to see me and ask about the facts already known to the whole wide world. The tuberculosis men would say &quot;There she is, the kidnapped woman.&quot; Dr. Park has had me illustrated in Chicago. I wonder how the said Dr. William H. Park would like to be insulted and put in the Journal and call him or his wife Typhoid William Park. " width="1056" height="4799" src="images/u7273-84.png?crc=511736528"/><!-- rasterized frame -->
